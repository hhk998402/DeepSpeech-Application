# django-deepspeech-server
This is [Mozilla deepspeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) server implemented in django. One can record sound in browser or upload compatible wav file and submit it to get corresponding text. It supports both HTTP/HTTPS and web sockets(ws).<br /> 
**Note:** For good results using websockets, deepspeech server should have GPU for higher inference rate and SSD is better as it promotes fast disk I/O.

## Acknowledgement
First of all, thanks to mozilla for such a awesome project. Speech to text is revolutionary technology that has huge scope in future and these type of open source efforts will definitely help nurture this tech.
I have used [wav-encoder](https://github.com/higuma/wav-audio-encoder-js) to encode recorded sound in wav format and [resampler](https://gist.github.com/frequent/34313277a46d5fb050f94a3769804287) to get 16000 Hz sample rate. Got some of my inspiration from [deepspeech-server](https://github.com/MainRo/deepspeech-server).

## Installation
Download or clone this project. This project uses python3. To run this project you need to first install deepspeech. Check out [deepspeech's README.md](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/blob/master/README.md) for details on how to install deepspeech on your machine.
    
Once deepspeech is installed, then run following command to install required dependencies of **django-deepspeech-server:**

    pip3 install -r path/to/django-deepspeech-server/requirements.txt

## Configuration
Enter path for your model, alphabet, lm and trie in speech-server-main/config/config.json file. Also make change to **audiofiledir** key in same config.json file, to match some valid path on your system. You can also limit audio length by setting [**audiofilelength**](https://github.com/ashwan1/django-deepspeech-server/issues/7) to some time in seconds.

Go to directory where manage.py is located and start server:

    python3 manage.py runserver
    
Go to your browser and browse to http://127.0.0.1:8000/dsserver.
Alternatively, you can use use https server, using below command:

    python3 manage.py runsslserver

Now you can access website over https (https://127.0.0.1:8000).

## TODO
- [x] Support for web sockets.
- [x] Input file validation.
- [ ] Real time inference.
- [ ] Provide Google speech API like response, so that one only has to change websocket address.
